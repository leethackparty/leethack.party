                    <h2>LeetHack - A programming challenge</h2>
                    <p>Do you like programming? So do we. We like it so much we turned it into a game that we play together at events. 
                        We designed it so that you can use any language you want in combination with your logic.
                        This game is meant to challenge you and your skills, whatever they are.</p> 
                    <p class="centeredSentences">Maybe you feel like trying out a new language and feel the heat right away? Join in.</p>
                    <p class="centeredSentences">Perhaps you like puzzles and programming and would like to mix them? Join in.</p>
                    <p class="centeredSentences">Or maybe you would just like to meet up with like-minded <s>freaks</s> nerds and geek it out? In either case. Join in.</p>

                    <h2>How is it played?</h2>
                    <p>You remember old MUDs? Well, if you're not 40+, it's basically a text-based game where you navigate your way through the game with text commands.</p>
                    <p>You'll find challenging obstacles to block your way, but by way of chance you'll be able to use programming to aid you on your quest to glory.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6 text">
                    <h2>How long does it take to play?</h2>
                    <p>That depends, but a game session is usually 4-7 hours depending on how deep into the game we're planning to go. This isn't a panic-stress game but 
                        rather a fairly relaxed experience where you handle the challenges in your own pace.</p>
                    <p>Every event will have a time frame, but whether you challenge everyone else for the best ranking or simply challenge yourself and learn something is up to you.</p>

                    <p>Strong words. No, no it's not. It is web based and even though we're not using all colors of the rainbow, and the 3D-effects are missing, it has been designed with 
                        game play in focus. </p>

                    <h2>Is there some sort of Personal Interface Matrix available?</h2>
                    <p>Glad you asked! The P.I.N.X. is your steady companion throughout the game and you can use it to interface with certain tools and to feed data in and out.</p>
